Boson uses game theory and independent resolvers to provide the bearer of an rNFT with strong and credible assurance, that either they will be able to redeem the token for the physical thing or receive their money back. Token-gated commerce: Redeemable NFTs can be programmed for access only by wallets holding specific NFTs or having a minimum ERC20 balance. rNFTs can thus be programmed with superpowers, for example enabling play-to-buy (complete a quest) and hold-to-buy (own a PFP).",Live,Non-custodial,Public,Polygon,$BOSON,2019,,,,https://www.bosonprotocol.io/,https://twitter.com/BosonProtocol,https://discord.com/invite/5dRV7fWet2,26/11/2023
